          A pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first
          move it can advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are unoccupied. A pawn can capture
          an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it by moving to that square.

          When a pawn makes a two-step advance from its starting position and there is an opponent's pawn on a square
          next to the destination square on an adjacent file, then the opponent's pawn can capture it en passant ("in
          passing"), moving to the square the pawn passed over. This can be done only on the turn immediately following
